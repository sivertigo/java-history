/** 
 * <p>This class represents a scope for identities. It is an Identity 
 * itself, and therefore has a name and can have a scope. It can also 
 * optionally have a public key and associated certificates.
 *
 * <p>An IdentityScope can contain Identity objects of all kinds, including
 * Signers. All types of Identity objects can be retrieved, added, and 
 * removed using the same methods. Note that it is possible, and in fact
 * expected, that different types of identity scopes will
 * apply different policies for their various operations on the
 * various types of Identities.
 *
 * <p>There is a one-to-one mapping between keys and identities, and 
 * there can only be one copy of one key per scope. For example, suppose
 * <b>Acme Software, Inc</b> is a software publisher known to a user.
 * Suppose it is an Identity, that is, it has a public key, and a set of
 * associated certificates. It is named in the scope using the name 
 * "Acme Software". No other named Identity in the scope has the same 
 * public  key. Of course, none has the same name as well.
