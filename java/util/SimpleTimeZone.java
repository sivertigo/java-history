     * By default, this constructor specifies day-of-week-in-month rules. That
     * is, if the startDay is 1, and the startDayOfWeek is SUNDAY, then this
     * indicates the first Sunday in the startMonth. A startDay of -1 likewise
     * indicates the last Sunday. However, by using negative or zero values for
     * certain parameters, other types of rules can be specified.
     *
     * Day of month. To specify an exact day of the month, such as March 1, set
     * startDayOfWeek to zero.
     *
     * Day of week after day of month. To specify the first day of the week
     * occurring on or after an exact day of the month, make the day of the week
     * negative. For example, if startDay is 5 and startDayOfWeek is -MONDAY,
     * this indicates the first Monday on or after the 5th day of the
     * startMonth.
     *
     * Day of week before day of month. To specify the last day of the week
     * occurring on or before an exact day of the month, make the day of the
     * week and the day of the month negative. For example, if startDay is -21
     * and startDayOfWeek is -WEDNESDAY, this indicates the last Wednesday on or
     * before the 21st of the startMonth.
     *

    //       lastSun  the last Sunday in the month
    //       lastMon  the last Monday in the month
    //       Sun>=8   first Sunday on or after the eighth
    //       Sun<=25  last Sunday on or before the 25th
    // This is further complicated by the fact that we need to remain
    // backward compatible with the 1.1 FCS.  Finally, we need to minimize
    // API changes.  In order to satisfy these requirements, we support
    // three representation systems, and we translate between them.
    //
    // INTERNAL REPRESENTATION
    // This is the format SimpleTimeZone objects take after construction or
    // streaming in is complete.  Rules are represented directly, using an
    // unencoded format.  We will discuss the start rule only below; the end
    // rule is analogous.
    //   startMode      Takes on enumerated values DAY_OF_MONTH,
    //                  DOW_IN_MONTH, DOW_AFTER_DOM, or DOW_BEFORE_DOM.
    //   startDay       The day of the month, or for DOW_IN_MONTH mode, a
    //                  value indicating which DOW, such as +1 for first,
    //                  +2 for second, -1 for last, etc.
    //   startDayOfWeek The day of the week.  Ignored for DAY_OF_MONTH.
    //
    // ENCODED REPRESENTATION
    // This is the format accepted by the constructor and by setStartRule()
    // and setEndRule().  It uses various combinations of positive, negative,
    // and zero values to encode the different rules.  This representation
    // allows us to specify all the different rule flavors without altering
    // the API.
    //   MODE              startMonth    startDay    startDayOfWeek
    //   DOW_IN_MONTH_MODE >=0           !=0         >0
    //   DOM_MODE          >=0           >0          ==0
    //   DOW_GE_DOM_MODE   >=0           >0          <0
    //   DOW_LE_DOM_MODE   >=0           <0          <0
    //   (no DST)          don't care    ==0         don't care
    //
    // STREAMED REPRESENTATION
    // We must retain binary compatibility with the 1.1 FCS.  The 1.1 code only
    // handles DOW_IN_MONTH_MODE and non-DST mode, the latter indicated by the
    // flag useDaylight.  When we stream an object out, we translate into an
    // approximate DOW_IN_MONTH_MODE representation so the object can be parsed
    // and used by 1.1 code.  Following that, we write out the full
    // representation separately so that contemporary code can recognize and
    // parse it.  The full representation is written in a "packed" format,
    // consisting of a version number, a length, and an array of bytes.  Future
    // versions of this class may specify different versions.  If they wish to
    // include additional data, they should do so by storing them after the
    // packed representation below.
