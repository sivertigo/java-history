/**
 * <code>Calendar</code> is an abstract base class for converting between
 * a <code>Date</code> object and a set of integer fields such as
 * <code>YEAR</code>, <code>MONTH</code>, <code>DAY</code>, <code>HOUR</code>,
 * and so on. (A <code>Date</code> object represents a specific instant in
 * time with millisecond precision. See
 * <a href="java.util.Date.html"><code>java.util.Date</code></a>
 * for information about the <code>Date</code> class.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Subclasses of <code>Calendar</code> interpret a <code>Date</code>
 * according to the rules of a specific calendar system. The JDK
 * provides one concrete subclass of <code>Calendar</code>:
 * <code>GregorianCalendar</code>. Future subclasses could represent
 * the various types of lunar calendars in use in many parts of the world.
 *
 * <p>
 * Like other locale-sensitive classes, <code>Calendar</code> provides a
 * class method, <code>getInstance</code>, for getting a generally useful
 * object of this type. <code>Calendar</code>'s <code>getInstance</code> method
 * returns a <code>GregorianCalendar</code> object whose
 * time fields have been initialized with the current date and time:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>Calendar</code> object can produce all the time field values
 * needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language
 * and calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional).
 *
 * <p>
 * When computing a <code>Date</code> from time fields, two special circumstances
 * may arise: there may be insufficient information to compute the
 * <code>Date</code> (such as only year and month but no day in the month),
 * or there may be inconsistent information (such as "Tuesday, July 15, 1996"
 * -- July 15, 1996 is actually a Monday).
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Insufficient information.</strong> The calendar will use default
 * information to specify the missing fields. This may vary by calendar; for
 * the Gregorian calendar, the default for a field is the same as that of the
 * start of the epoch: i.e., YEAR = 1970, MONTH = JANUARY, DATE = 1, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Inconsistent information.</strong> If fields conflict, the calendar
 * will give preference to fields set more recently. For example, when
 * determining the day, the calendar will look for one of the following
 * combinations of fields.  The most recent combination, as determined by the
 * most recently set single field, will be used.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * MONTH + DAY_OF_MONTH
 * MONTH + WEEK_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK
 * MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK
 * DAY_OF_YEAR
 * DAY_OF_WEEK + WEEK_OF_YEAR
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * For the time of day:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * HOUR_OF_DAY
 * AM_PM + HOUR
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> for some non-Gregorian calendars, different
 * fields may be necessary for complete disambiguation. For example, a full
 * specification of the historial Arabic astronomical calendar requires year,
 * month, day-of-month <em>and</em> day-of-week in some cases.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> There are certain possible ambiguities in
 * interpretation of certain singular times, which are resolved in the
 * following ways:
 * <ol>
 *     <li> 24:00:00 "belongs" to the following day. That is,
 *          23:59 on Dec 31, 1969 &lt; 24:00 on Jan 1, 1970 &lt; 24:01:00 on Jan 1, 1970
 *
 *     <li> Although historically not precise, midnight also belongs to "am",
 *          and noon belongs to "pm", so on the same day,
 *          12:00 am (midnight) &lt; 12:01 am, and 12:00 pm (noon) &lt; 12:01 pm
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * The date or time format strings are not part of the definition of a
 * calendar, as those must be modifiable or overridable by the user at
 * runtime. Use <a href="java.text.DateFormat.html">java.text.DateFormat</a>
 * to format dates.
 *
 * <p><strong>Field manipulation methods</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p><code>Calendar</code> fields can be changed using three methods:
 * <code>set()</code>, <code>add()</code>, and <code>roll()</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong><code>set(f, value)</code></strong> changes field
 * <code>f</code> to <code>value</code>.  In addition, it sets an
 * internal member variable to indicate that field <code>f</code> has
 * been changed. Although field <code>f</code> is changed immediately,
 * the calendar's milliseconds is not recomputed until the next call to
 * <code>get()</code>, <code>getTime()</code>, or
 * <code>getTimeInMillis()</code> is made. Thus, multiple calls to
 * <code>set()</code> do not trigger multiple, unnecessary
 * computations. As a result of changing a field using
 * <code>set()</code>, other fields may also change, depending on the
 * field, the field value, and the calendar system. In addition,
 * <code>get(f)</code> will not necessarily return <code>value</code>
 * after the fields have been recomputed. The specifics are determined by
 * the concrete calendar class.</p>
 * 
 * <p><em>Example</em>: Consider a <code>GregorianCalendar</code>
 * originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling <code>set(Calendar.MONTH,
 * Calendar.SEPTEMBER)</code> sets the calendar to September 31,
 * 1999. This is a temporary internal representation that resolves to
 * October 1, 1999 if <code>getTime()</code>is then called. However, a
 * call to <code>set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 30)</code> before the call to
 * <code>getTime()</code> sets the calendar to September 30, 1999, since
 * no recomputation occurs after <code>set()</code> itself.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong><code>add(f, delta)</code></strong> adds <code>delta</code>
 * to field <code>f</code>.  This is equivalent to calling <code>set(f,
 * get(f) + delta)</code> with two adjustments:</p>
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 *   <p><strong>Add rule 1</strong>. The value of field <code>f</code>
 *   after the call minus the value of field <code>f</code> before the
 *   call is <code>delta</code>, modulo any overflow that has occurred in
 *   field <code>f</code>. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
 *   range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
 *   decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.</p>
 * 
 *   <p><strong>Add rule 2</strong>. If a smaller field is expected to be
 *   invariant, but &nbsp; it is impossible for it to be equal to its
 *   prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after field
 *   <code>f</code> is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close
 *   as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a
 *   smaller unit of time. <code>HOUR</code> is a smaller field than
 *   <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code>. No adjustment is made to smaller fields
 *   that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
 *   determines what fields are expected to be invariant.</p>
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>In addition, unlike <code>set()</code>, <code>add()</code> forces
 * an immediate recomputation of the calendar's milliseconds and all
 * fields.</p>
 * 
 * <p><em>Example</em>: Consider a <code>GregorianCalendar</code>
 * originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling <code>add(Calendar.MONTH,
 * 13)</code> sets the calendar to September 30, 2000. <strong>Add rule
 * 1</strong> sets the <code>MONTH</code> field to September, since
 * adding 13 months to August gives September of the next year. Since
 * <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> cannot be 31 in September in a
 * <code>GregorianCalendar</code>, <strong>add rule 2</strong> sets the
 * <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> to 30, the closest possible value. Although
 * it is a smaller field, <code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code> is not adjusted by
 * rule 2, since it is expected to change when the month changes in a
 * <code>GregorianCalendar</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong><code>roll(f, up/down)</code></strong> adds
 * <code>+1/-1</code> to field <code>f</code> without changing larger
 * fields. This is equivalent to calling <code>add(f, +1/-1)</code> with
 * the following adjustment:</p>
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 *   <p><strong>Roll rule</strong>. Larger fields are unchanged after the
 *   call. A larger field represents a larger unit of
 *   time. <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> is a larger field than
 *   <code>HOUR</code>.</p>
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * <p><em>Example</em>: Consider a <code>GregorianCalendar</code> originally
 * set to October 31, 1999. Calling <code>roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)</code>
 * sets the calendar to November 30, 1999. Add
 * rule 1 sets the <code>MONTH</code> field to November. Using a
 * <code>GregorianCalendar</code>, the <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> cannot
 * be 31 in the month November. Add rule 2 sets it to the closest possible
 * value, 30. Calling <code>roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)</code> two more
 * times sets the calendar further to January 30, <strong>1999</strong>.
 * When rolling from December to January, the roll rule maintains the
 * <code>YEAR</code> field value of 1999.</p>
 * 
 * <p><em>Example</em>: Consider a <code>GregorianCalendar</code>
 * originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling
 * <code>roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, false)</code> sets the calendar to
 * Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling
 * <code>add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)</code> sets the calendar to
 * Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an
 * additional constraint: The <code>MONTH</code> must not change when the
 * <code>WEEK_OF_MONTH</code> is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1,
 * the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June
 * 5. According to add rule 2, the <code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code>, an invariant
 * when changing the <code>WEEK_OF_MONTH</code>, is set to Tuesday, the
 * closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the
 * week).</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Usage model</strong>. To motivate the behavior of
 * <code>add()</code> and <code>roll()</code>, consider a user interface
 * component with increment and decrement buttons for the month, day, and
 * year, and an underlying <code>GregorianCalendar</code>. If the
 * interface reads January 31, 1999 and the user presses the month
 * increment button, what should it read? If the underlying
 * implementation uses <code>set()</code>, it might read March 3, 1999.
 * A better result would be February 28, 1999.  If the underlying
 * implementation uses <code>add(Calendar.MONTH, 1)</code>,
 * it will read February 28, 1999.  Furthermore, if the user presses
 * the month increment button again, it should read March 31, 1999,
 * not March 28, 1999. By saving the original date and using
 * <code>add(Calendar.MONTH, 2)</code>, after the user presses the month
 * increment button twice, it will read March 31, 1999 as most users
 * will intuitively expect.  In contrast, since <code>roll()</code> can
 * only go up or down by one, calling <code>roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)</code>
 * twice will result in March 28, 1999. In addition, <code>roll()</code>
 * does not change the YEAR field.</p>

public abstract class Calendar implements Serializable, Cloneable {

    // Data flow in Calendar
    // ---------------------

    // The current time is represented in two ways by Calendar: as UTC
    // milliseconds from the epoch start (1 January 1970 0:00 UTC), and as local
    // fields such as MONTH, HOUR, AM_PM, etc.  It is possible to compute the
    // millis from the fields, and vice versa.  The data needed to do this
    // conversion is encapsulated by a TimeZone object owned by the Calendar.
    // The data provided by the TimeZone object may also be overridden if the
    // user sets the ZONE_OFFSET and/or DST_OFFSET fields directly. The class
    // keeps track of what information was most recently set by the caller, and
    // uses that to compute any other information as needed.

    // If the user sets the fields using set(), the data flow is as follows.
    // This is implemented by the Calendar subclass's computeTime() method.
    // During this process, certain fields may be ignored.  The disambiguation
    // algorithm for resolving which fields to pay attention to is described
    // above.

    //   local fields (YEAR, MONTH, DATE, HOUR, MINUTE, etc.)
    //           |
    //           | Using Calendar-specific algorithm
    //           V
    //   local standard millis
    //           |
    //           | Using TimeZone or user-set ZONE_OFFSET / DST_OFFSET
    //           V
    //   UTC millis (in time data member)

    // If the user sets the UTC millis using setTime(), the data flow is as
    // follows.  This is implemented by the Calendar subclass's computeFields()
    // method.

    //   UTC millis (in time data member)
    //           |
    //           | Using TimeZone getOffset()
    //           V
    //   local standard millis
    //           |
    //           | Using Calendar-specific algorithm
    //           V
    //   local fields (YEAR, MONTH, DATE, HOUR, MINUTE, etc.)

    // In general, a round trip from fields, through local and UTC millis, and
    // back out to fields is made when necessary.  This is implemented by the
    // complete() method.  Resolving a partial set of fields into a UTC millis
    // value allows all remaining fields to be generated from that value.  If
    // the Calendar is lenient, the fields are also renormalized to standard
    // ranges when they are regenerated.
