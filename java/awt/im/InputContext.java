/**
 * An InputContext object manages the communication between text editing
 * components and input methods. It dispatches events between them, and
 * forwards requests for information from the input method to the text
 * editing component. It also lets text editing components select input
 * methods by locale.
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, one InputContext instance is created per Window instance,
 * and this input context is shared by all components within the window's
 * container hierarchy. However, this means that only one text input
 * operation is possible at any one time within a window, and that the
 * text needs to be committed when moving the focus from one text component
 * to another. If this is not desired, text components can create their
 * own input context instances.
 *
 * <p>
 * Not all platforms and locales support input methods. Where input methods are
 * unavailable, input contexts can still be created and used; the
 * InputContext instance methods return without doing anything (selectLocale
 * returns false).
