/**
 * This interface defines a protocol for bidirectional iteration over text.
 * The iterator iterates over a bounded sequence of characters.  Characters
 * are indexed with values beginning with the value returned by getBeginIndex and
 * continuing through the value returned by getEndIndex()-1.  The index of the
 * current character can be retrieved by calling getIndex.  Calling setIndex
 * will move the iterator to a new position within the sequence of characters.
 * If at any time the iterator's current index moves outside the range of
 * getBeginIndex and getEndIndex, previous() and next() will return DONE, signaling that
 * the iterator has reached the end of the sequence.
 * <P>Examples:<P>
 *
 * Traverse the text from start to finish
 * <pre>
 * public void traverseForward(CharacterIterator iter) {
 *     for(char c = iter.first(); c != CharacterIterator.DONE; c = iter.next()) {
 *         processChar(c);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Traverse the text backwards, from end to start
 * <pre>
 * public void traverseBackward(CharacterIterator iter) {
 *     for(char c = iter.last(); c != CharacterIterator.DONE; c = iter.prev()) {
 *         processChar(c);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Traverse both forward and backward from a given position in the text.
 * Calls to notBoundary() in this example represents some
 * additional stopping criteria.
 * <pre>
 * public void traverseOut(CharacterIterator iter, int pos) {
 *     for (char c = iter.setIndex(pos);
 *          c != CharacterIterator.DONE && notBoundary(c);
 *          c = iter.next()) {}
 * int end = iter.getIndex();
 * for (char c = iter.setIndex(pos);
 *     c != CharacterIterator.DONE && notBoundary(c);
 *     c = iter.prev()) {}
 * int start = iter.getIndex();
 * processSection(start,end);
 * }
