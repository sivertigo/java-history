/**
 * <code>ParsePosition</code> is a simple class used by <code>Format</code>
 * and its subclasses to keep track of the current position during parsing.
 * The <code>parseObject</code> method in the various <code>Format</code>
 * classes requires a <code>ParsePosition</code> object as an argument.
 *
 * <p> 
 * By design, as you parse through a string with different formats,
 * you can use the same <code>ParsePosition</code>, since the index parameter
 * records the current position.
