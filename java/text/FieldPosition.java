/**
 * <code>FieldPosition</code> is a simple class used by <code>Format</code>
 * and its subclasses to identify fields in formatted output. Fields are
 * identified by constants, whose names typically end with <code>_FIELD</code>,
 * defined in the various subclasses of <code>Format</code>. See
 * <code>ERA_FIELD</code> and its friends in <code>DateFormat</code> for
 * an example.
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>FieldPosition</code> keeps track of the position of the
 * field within the formatted output with two indices: the index
 * of the first character of the field and the index of the last
 * character of the field.
 *
 * <p>
 * One version of the <code>format</code> method in the various
 * <code>Format</code> classes requires a <code>FieldPosition</code>
 * object as an argument. You use this <code>format</code> method
 * to perform partial formatting or to get information about the
 * formatted output (such as the position of a field).
