/**
 * This class extends ThreadLocal to provide inheritance of values from parent
 * Thread to child Thread: when a child thread is created, the child receives
 * initial values for all InheritableThreadLocals for which the parent has
 * values.  Normally the child's values will be identical to the parent's;
 * however, the child's value can be made an arbitrary function of the parent's
 * by overriding the childValue method in this class.
 * <p>
 * InheritableThreadLocal variables are used in preference to ordinary
 * ThreadLocal variables when the per-thread-attribute being maintained in the
 * variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be automatically transmitted
 * to any child threads that are created.
