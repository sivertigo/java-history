/**
 * The styled text support uses a tree of view objects to 
 * represent the view of the model.  This gives a number of 
 * advantages over a monolithic formatter, but has a substantial 
 * disadvantage as well.  For large documents, a large number of 
 * view objects will be created.  To account for this, a view 
 * implementation is needed that recognizes it is getting large, 
 * and creates zones where it doesn't create the child view objects 
 * until an attempt is made to display them.  Box views are well suited 
 * to this because:
 *   <ul>
 *   <li>
 *   Boxes are a heavily used view, and having a box that
 *   provides this behavior gives substantial opportunity
 *   to plug the behavior into a view hierarchy from the
 *   view factory.
 *   <li>
 *   Boxes are tiled in one direction, so it is easy to
 *   divide them into zones in a reliable way.
 *   <li>
 *   Boxes have a simple relationship to the model (i.e. they
 *   create child views that directly represent the child elements).
 *   <li>
 *   Boxes are easier to estimate the size of than some other shapes.
 *   </ul>
 * <p>
 * BigBoxView extends BoxView to provide a box that implements
 * zones for it's children.  The zones are special BoxView implementations
 * that don't necessarily create/store the children.  The display
 * zones can be used to delay the creation of child views and/or to 
 * reduce the amount of memory consumed by keeping zones built only if
 * there is viewing/editing activity in the zone.
