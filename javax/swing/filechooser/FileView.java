/**
 * FileView defines an abstract class that can be implemented to
 * provide the filechooser with ui information for a File.
 *
 * Each L&F JFileChooserUI object implements this class to pass
 * back the correct icons and type descriptions specific to
 * that L&F. For example, the Windows L&F returns the generic Windows
 * icons for directories and generic files.
 *
 * Additionally, you may want to provide your own FileView to
 * JFileChooser to return different icons or additional information
 * using {@link javax.swing.JFileChooser#setFileView}.
 *
 * JFileChooser first looks to see if there is a user defined FileView,
 * if there is, it gets type information from there first. If FileView
 * returns null for any method, JFileChooser then uses the L&F specific
 * view to get the information.
 *
 * So, for example, if you provide a FileView class that returns an
 * <code>Icon</code> for JPG files, and returns <code>null</code>
 * icons for all other files, the UI's FileView will provide default
 * icons for all other files.
 *
 * For an example implementation of a simple file filter, see
 * <code><i>yourJDK</i>/demo/jfc/FileChooserDemo/ExampleFileView.java</code>.
 * For more information, see the Swing Connection article on the 
 * <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/swingdoc-current/file_chooser.html">File Chooser</a>
