/**
 * This interface defines the methods any general editor should be able
 * to implement. <p>
 *
 * Having this interface enables complex components (the client of the
 * editor) such as JList, JTree, and JTable to allow any generic editor to
 * edit values in a table cell, or tree cell, etc.  Without this generic
 * editor interface, JTable would have to know about specific editors,
 * such as JTextField, JCheckBox, JComboBox, etc.  In addition, without
 * this interface, clients of editors such as JTable would not be able
 * to work with any editors developed in the future by the user
 * or a 3rd party ISV. <p>
 *
 * To use this interface, a developer creating a new editor can have the
 * new component implement the interface.  Or the developer can
 * choose a wrapper based approch and provide a companion object which
 * implements the CellEditor interface (See JCellEditor for example).  The
 * wrapper approch is particularly useful if the user want to use a
 * 3rd party ISV editor with JTable, but the ISV didn't implement the
 * CellEditor interface.  The user can simply create an object that
 * contains an instance of the 3rd party editor object and "translate"
 * the CellEditor API into the 3rd party editor's API.

     * depending on the exact type of <I>anEvent</I>.  For example, with
     * a text field editor, if the event is a mouse event the editor
     * might start editing with the cursor at the clicked point.  If
     * the event is a keyboard event, it might want replace the value
     * of the text field with that first key, etc.  <I>anEvent</I>
     * is in the invoking component's coordinate system.  A null value
     * is a valid parameter for <I>anEvent</I>, and it is up to the editor
     * to determine what is the default starting state.  For example,
     * a text field editor might want to select all the text and start
     * editing if <I>anEvent</I> is null.  The editor can assume

     * from changing for some types of edits.  eg. A table that contains
     * a column of check boxes, the user might want to be able to change
     * those checkboxes without altering the selection.  (See Netscape
     * Communicator for just such an example)  Of course, it is up to
